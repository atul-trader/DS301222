# DSA - Data Structure and Algorithm

# Data Structure is a collection of data, the relationship amongs them and the operations
# organizing the data
# managing the data

# (bricks,cement,rodes,woods) -> supervisor -> buildling
# (ds)                        -> code       -> software

# Algorithm 
# step by step procedure to solve a problem efficiently
