# Time Complexity
# time taken by program to give the response

lst = [6,8,19,20,4,78,1,22,30,9]
# Best Case = lst[0]
# Average Case = lst[5] = 6 iterations
# Worst Case = lst[9] = 10 iterations

# Time Complexities : 
# 1. Constant Time - O(1)
# a = 10
# b = 20

# if a > b:
#     return True
# else:
#     return False



# 2. Linear Time - O(n)

# data = 10
# for i in data:
#     print(i)



# 3. Quadratic Time - O(n^2)

# for x in data:
#     for y in data:
#         print(x,y)



# 4. Exponential Time - O(2^n)
